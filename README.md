Simple tool for creating pitch timeline, this program divides midi creation into `pitches` and `timeline` part.

When creating timeline, press <kbd>A</kbd> to give position/duration information, and use <kbd>S</kbd> to split different notes directly when holding <kbd>A</kbd>

```python
# Twinkle Little Star
[45, 45, 52, 52, 54, 54, 52, 50, 50, 49, 49, 47, 47, 45, 52, 52, 50, 50, 49, 49, 47, 52, 52, 50, 50, 49, 49, 47, 45, 45, 52, 52, 54, 54, 52, 50, 50, 49, 49, 47, 47, 45]
```

> Tip: press <kbd>K</kbd> in pitch window, and input code in console (__it's recommended to launch this application in console__)

The name of the project is *Hachiko*, inspired by the golden yellow Akita dog - ハチ公, which is in homophonic with "扒公" (means melody extraction "耳 Copy" or "扒谱").

## Installing

~~There's no need for system-wide installation, just use the script `hachi.py`~~

Since version 1.1, setting up the installation using `setuptools` is required.

```bash
python3 setup.py install # can be --user or sudo
```

System library [FluidSynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth) is required to run this application.

### Old install-free version

See [release 1.0](https://github.com/duangsuse-valid-projects/Hachiko/releases/tag/v1.0)

```bash
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
python3 hachi.py
# use midnotes.py to replace srt2mid.py print-notes
```

## UI Control / Basic Routine

Hachiko is self documented, so just use the program.

```bash
hachiko -h
```

> NOTE: For the first time using GUI, you can spend more time learning hot keys

Once `puzi.srt` is generated, you can use `srt2mid puzi.srt` to transform it into MIDI file

Btw, you can use pitches from extrenal tool (like [Synthesizer V](https://synthesizerv.com/) editor or [MidiEditor](https://www.midieditor.org/)) extracted by `srt2mid print-notes puzi.mid` instead of built-in approach

Btw, there's also an option to use [MELODIA Algorithm](https://github.com/duangsuse-valid-projects/audio_to_midi_melodia) to extract pitches directly from music

## Tool `srt2mid` and `lrc_merge`

[srt2mid.py](hachiko/cli_tools/srt2mid.py) can be used to make conversation between SRT / MIDI File format

Output filename is determined automatically from input path, and SRT representation of MIDI track will be timeline of integer(note pitch)s.

The default mode, "from", means "from srt to mid", and when extracting lyrics from mid file you have to use "back-lyrics" instead.

```plain
Usage: srt2mid [ from/back/back-lyrics/print-notes ] files...
```

[lrc_merge.py](hachiko/cli_tools/lrc_merge.py) can be used to merge words-based lyrics into sentence-based lyrics

```plain
usage: lrc_merge [-h] [-dist n_sec] [-min-len n_sec] [-o name] [-sep word_seprator] (path / 'lrc')
```

+ `dist` max distance for words in same sentence, default `0.8`
+ `min-len` min duration for the last word in sentence (only when `lrc` input is used)

Execute `lrc_merge -h` to see full details
